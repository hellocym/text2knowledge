MONDO:0019121	pneumocystosis	Disease	MONDO	Human pneumocystosis is caused by an infectious agent, which (after recent nomenclature and taxonomy revisions) is now classed as the fungus Pneumocystis jiroveci. The prevalence is unknown. Pneumocystis jiroveci is an opportunistic infectious agent, developing in immunosuppressed patients. It is an air-borne infection, localised to the lungs. However, extrapulmonary involvement is seen in AIDS patients. The disease manifests progressively with coughing, respiratory problems (dyspnea) and fever, followed by acute respiratory insufficiency and death within a few weeks in untreated cases. The most reliable diagnostic method is bronchoalveolar lavage. The treatment of choice is cotrimoxazole.

They may includepersonality or moodchanges, intellectual impairment, abnormal movements,a depressed level of consciousness, and other symptoms.There are several theories regarding the exact cause, butdevelopment of the condition isprobablyat least partiallydue to the effect of substances that are toxic to nerve tissue (neurotoxic), which are typically present with liver damage and/or liver disease. Treatment depends upon the severity of mental status changes and upon the certainty of the diagnosis.

MONDO:0013343	C1Q deficiency	Disease	MONDO	C1q deficiency is a rare disorder associated with recurrent skin lesions, chronic infections, systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) or SLE-like diseases. It has also been associated with a kidney disease known as mesangial proliferative glomerulonephritis. C1q is a complex and together with other proteins, C1r and C1s, it forms the C1 complex. This complex is important for the activation of the complement system (a group of proteins that work with the immune system). It also disposes cells that are dead. C1q deficiency presents in 2 different forms, absent C1q protein or abnormal C1q protein. Symptoms include infections (ear infections (otitis media), meningitis, urinary tract infections, oral infections); skin lesions (small blisters (vesicles), dark patches, and atrophic areas) that get worse upon light exposure; cataracts; loss of eyelashes, eyebrows, and scalp hair; blood in urine; and glomerulonephritis. About 93% of cases are associated with systemic lupus erythematosus. It can be caused by mutations in the C1QA, C1QB or C1QC genes and is inherited in an autosomal recessive pattern. Treatment depends on the symptoms. Recently, it was shown that C1q production can be restored by allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation, a procedure in which a person receives blood-forming stem cells (cells from which all blood cells develop) from a genetically similar, but not identical donor.

Of the few reported cases in the literature, some patients also had eye involvement that included nystagmus (in voluntary eye movements)and saccadic pursuit eye movements. Out of 5 affected siblings examined in a large Dutch family, 2 became wheelchair-dependent late in life. The severity of the symptoms varies from mild to severe. SCAR7 is caused by mutations in the TPP1 gene and is inherited in an autosomal recessive manner.

MONDO:0005879	ocular toxoplasmosis	Disease	MONDO	Ocular toxoplasmosis is an infection in the eye caused by the parasite, Toxoplasm a gondii. Toxoplasmosis is the most common cause of eye inflammation in the world. Toxoplamosis can beacquired or present at birth (congenital), having crossed the placenta from a newly infected mother to her fetus. Most humans acquire toxoplasmosis by eating raw or undercooked meat, vegetables or milk products, or by coming into contact with infected cat litterbox or sandboxes.In humans,the infectionusually causes no symptoms, and resolves without treatment in a few months. In individuals with compromised immune systems, Toxoplasm a gondii can reactivate to cause disease. Reactivation of a congenital infection was traditionally thought to be the most common cause ofocular toxoplasmosis, but an acquired infection is now considered to be more common. A toxoplasmosis infection that affects the eye usually attacks the retina andinitially resolves without symptoms. However,the inactive parasite maylaterreactivate causing eyepain, blurred vision, and possibly permanent damage, including blindness. Although most cases of toxoplasmosis resolve on their own,for some,inflammation can be treated with antibiotics and steroids.

MONDO:0001553	phacolytic glaucoma	Disease	MONDO	An abnormal condition characterized by an acute autoimmune reaction of the eye. It is caused by hypersensitivity of the eye to the protein of the crystalline lens and commonly follows trauma to the crystalline lens or cataract surgery. Associated symptoms include swelling and inflammation of the eye, severe pain, and blurred vision. The substance of the lens is invaded by polymorphonuclear cells and mononuclear phagocytes. Accurate diagnosis must differentiate between this condition and infectious endophthalmitis. Therapy is supportive and commonly includes the administration of corticosteroids and atropine. Refractory cases may require surgical removal of the lens.

MONDO:0009509	Landau-Kleffner syndrome	Disease	MONDO	Landau-Kleffner syndrome (LKS) is a rare neurological syndrome characterized by the sudden or gradual development of aphasia (the inability to understand or express language) and recurrent seizures (epilepsy). Children with LKS typically develop normally until signs and symptoms of the syndrome begin to develop between age 2 and 8 years. Males are more often affected by LKS than females. In about 20% of people with LKS, mutations (changes) in the GRIN2A gene have been identified. The syndrome is inherited in an autosomal dominant manner. In other cases, the syndrome may be caused by changes to other unidentified genes. LKS is diagnosed when a doctor sees clinical features that are consistent with the syndrome such as a loss of speech and an electroencephalogram (EEG) that shows specific kinds of seizure activity. Genetic testing can be used to confirm if there is a mutation in GRIN2A, but this testing is not done routinely. Treatment for LKS usually consists of medications such as anticonvulsants and corticosteroids to help prevent seizures. Speech therapy should also be started promptly in order to ensure the best long-term outlook for children with LKS.

MONDO:0012519	Rubinstein-Taybi syndrome due to 16p13.3 microdeletion	Disease	MONDO	Chromosome 16p13.3deletion syndrome is a chromosome abnormality that can affect many parts of the body. People with this condition are missing a small piece (deletion) of chromosome 16 at a location designated p13.3. Although once thought to be a severe form of Rubinstein-Taybi syndrome, it is now emerging as a unique syndrome. Signs and symptoms may include failure to thrive, hypotonia (reduced muscle tone), short stature, microcephaly (unusually small head), characteristic facial features, mild to moderate intellectual disability, organ anomalies (i.e. heart and/or kidney problems), and vulnerability to infections. Chromosome testing of both parents can provide information about whether the deletion was inherited. In most cases, parents do not have any chromosome abnormalities. However, sometimes one parent has a balanced translocation where a piece of a chromosome has broken off and attached to another one with no gain or loss of genetic material. The balanced translocation normally does not cause signs or symptoms, but it increases the risk for having a child with a chromosome abnormality like a deletion. Treatment is based on the signs and symptoms present in each person.To learn more about chromosome abnormalities in general, view our GARD fact sheet on Chromosome Disorders.

MONDO:0018615	hemicrania continua	Disease	MONDO	Hemicrania continua (HC) is a type of primary headache disorder, which means the headache is not caused by another medical condition. Symptoms of HC include constant mild to moderate pain on one side of the head (unilateral) with periods of more intense, severe, migraine -like pain (exacerbations). These severe pain periods can last from 20 minutes to days. The frequency of exacerbations also varies greatly. The headache stays on the same side of the head and usually without pain free periods. HC is more common in women and most often starts in adulthood, but may begin anywhere from 5 to 67 years of age. Diagnosis of hemicrania continua (HC) is made by ruling out other possible causes of the pain and by clinical symptoms. During the periods of severe pain, at least one of the following symptoms must be present on same side of the body as the headache: watering or red eyes (conjunctival injection), congested or runny nose, or drooping eyelid. In addition, the headache pain must respond to treatment with indomethacin. The cause of HC is unknown. Other treatments for those who cannot tolerate long term indomethacin therapy are being studied.

MONDO:0018124	Oncogenic osteomalacia	Disease	MONDO	Oncogenic osteomalacia is characterized by the development of a tumor that causes the bones to be weakened. This occurs when a tumor secretes a substance called fibroblast growth factor 23 (FGF23). FGF23 inhibits the ability of the kidneys to absorb phosphate. Phosphate is important for keeping bones strong and healthy. Therefore, this disease is characterized by a softening and weakening of the bones (osteomalacia). The disease also results in multiple biochemical abnormalities including high levels of phosphate in the urine (hyperphosphaturia) and low levels of phosphate in the blood (hypophosphatemia). The majority of tumors that cause oncogenic osteomalacia are small and slow-growing. These tumors most commonly occur in the skin, muscles, or bones of the extremities or in the paranasal sinuses around the head. Most of these tumors are benign, meaning they are not associated with cancer. The exact reason that the tumors associated with oncogenic osteomalacia develop is not known. The disease is diagnosed when a person experiences clinical features such as bone weakening and hyperphosphaturia and a tumor is found by imaging of the body. Treatment of the disease consists of surgical removal of the tumor. The symptoms of the disease, including the weakening of the bones, typically resolve once the tumor is removed.

MONDO:0020121	muscular dystrophy	Disease	MONDO	Muscular dystrophy (MD) refers to a group of more than 30 genetic diseases characterized by progressive weakness and degeneration of the skeletal muscles that control movement. Some forms of MD are seen in newborns, infants or children, while others have late-onset and may not appear until middle age or later. The disorders differ in terms of the distribution and extent of muscle weakness (some forms of MD also affect cardiac muscle), age of onset, rate of progression, and pattern of inheritance. The prognosis for people with MD varies according to the type and progression of the disorder. There is no specific treatment to stop or reverse any form of MD. Treatment is supportive and may include physical therapy, respiratory therapy, speech therapy, orthopedic appliances used for support, corrective orthopedic surgery, and medicationsincluding corticosteroids, anticonvulsants (seizure medications), immunosuppressants, and antibiotics. Some individuals may need assisted ventilation to treat respiratory muscle weaknessor a pacemaker for cardiac (heart)abnormalities.
